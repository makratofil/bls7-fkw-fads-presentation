# Intro
This repository contains information related to my presentation at the 7th International Bio-logging Science Symposium titled, *"More than just a fad? Endangered false killer whale movements in relation to fish aggregating devices (FADs) in Hawai'i*, co-authored by Robin Baird. 

A PDF copy of the poster will be available for download here, and information on funding, references, and acknowledgements are summarised below.

## Funding
- Funding for field efforts was provided from the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), the State of Hawai'i (Dept of Land and Natural Resources), and the U.S. Navy. 

- Funding for this presentation was supported by Oregon Gray Whale License Plate royalties to Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute

- Tagging was undertaken under NMFS Permit Nos 731-1174, 15330 and 20605

## Acknowledgments
- False killer whale and FAD photos included in poster were taken by Jordan Lerma, Amy Van Cise, Robin Baird, Dan McSweeney, Daniel Webster/Cascadia Research Collective (c)

- Tuna photo was taken by Kimberly Jeffries (c)

- We thank Daniel Webster, Greg Schorr, Allan Ligon, and Colin Cornforth for deploying satellite tags 

- We thank Kim Holland for providing information on the Hawai'i FAD array

- We thank Erin Oleson (PIFSC) for providing satellite tag data on 5 endangered false killer whales
